Welcome to ROOMMATE-ALLOCATION-APP.

This was originally the idea for my COMP350 Course group final project, but because my group changed the objective to another app (find that here: https://github.com/datcuriousguy/monty-s-magicians), I decided to pursue and rebuild this one from scratch myself.

This application will use the following languages:

- Python (Backend)
- MySQL (Data Storage)
- HTML, CSS, & Javascript (Frontend)

Currently, the backend and data retrieval is fully functional.

I need to connect existing frontend to this backend code.

Once the frontend is working with the python file, I will be sure to update the python code, un-comment the flask api requests, and upload the html, css and javascript files.

However, given a sample database with the following partially populated tables;

 - hobbies                           
 - room_student_map                  
 - student_id_ac_fan_map             
 - student_id_ac_temp_fan_speed_map  
 - student_id_bedtime_preference_map 
 - student_id_hobbies_map            
 - student_info 

... the backend is fully functional.
